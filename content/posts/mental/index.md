But it’s not a topic I hear much about in our industry.

Our work comes with unique challenges:
👹 Discovery: The right architecture often shows itself only over time. Complex problems need to be handled with an agile, step-by-step approach.
👹 Estimation: It’s hard to predict how long things will take upfront, which can lead to pressure from clients who don’t fully understand the craft of development.
👹 Flow: Writing good code requires a certain mental state — sometimes called flow. When we’re stressed or drained, it’s harder to get into that state, which can create even more stress.
👹 No shutdown: Even when we shut down the computer, our minds often keep thinking about the work.

As an empathetic person who doesn’t like to disappoint, I’ve learned all of this the hard way:
💆‍♂️ Accepting that the right solution takes time to develop.
💆‍♂️ Being honest with clients about estimates — giving a best, worst, and likely scenario — and avoiding cutting corners, because there’s never time to "clean it up later."
💆‍♂️ Stopping myself from working longer hours when I can’t get into flow, knowing that overworking today will only make tomorrow harder.
💆‍♂️ Letting go, even if a deadline is missed and there are negative consequences for the client.

Just like physical health, mental well-being matters — what I like to call mental hygiene. In a fast-moving industry where we’re always learning and adapting, taking care of our mental health is crucial to avoid burnout.

My advice:
🙏 To managers: Protect your team even more than your clients.
🙏 To educators: Bring this topic into your classrooms.
🙏 To developers: When things don’t go as planned, it’s because this is a difficult job, not because you’re failing. If your surroundings can't accept this, you deserve better surroundings. And don't say "fine" when you're not, it's good to talk about this.
🙏 To clients: You’re fortunate to have dedicated developers. Trust that they’re doing their best, and know that pressuring them will only hurt the process in the long run.

By the way, even though it's easy to write about this, it's still a constant struggle for me. I burned out a few years ago, and I'm still kind of recovering from that. Luckily I can sense the signals now and learned to surround myself with only those that want the best for me.
